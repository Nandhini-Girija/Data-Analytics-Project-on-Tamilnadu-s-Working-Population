## **Workflow**  
### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Removed redundant attributes (e.g., **State Code, Table Code**).  
- Normalized dataset structure for **efficient processing**.  
- Handled missing values and formatted age groups.  
- Mapped industry categories to **short codes for easier visualization**.  

### **2. Gender & Age Distribution Analysis**  
- Compared **male vs. female workforce participation** in different industries.  
- Used **pie charts, bar graphs, and heatmaps** to visualize gender disparities.  
- Modeled **age distribution trends** to predict future workforce shifts.  

### **3. Industry-Wise Employment Trends**  
- Analyzed **top 5 industries with the highest workforce concentration**.  
- Explored **employment trends across 33 districts** of Tamil Nadu.  
- Evaluated **young workforce participation** in emerging industries.
